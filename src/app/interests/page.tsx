            Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being
            outdoors. On the weekend, I am always riding my motorcycle, I enjoy
            freediving and spearfishing also.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-0">
            When forced indoors, I usually play online games, and I spend a
            large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology
            advancements in the front-end web development world.
